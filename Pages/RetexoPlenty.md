  <p><b>Retextures o' Plenty is a resource pack for the Biomes o Plenty mod, which aims to enhance some of the mod's textures!<br>
      Currently, the pack retextures around 300+ of the mods textures, including adding variants for certain blocks to enhance certain biomes<br>
  
Later on, there are plans to integrate compatibility for BOP's addon mods, but for the time being its just the base mod.<br></p>
